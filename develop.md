# Todo

1. Port to python 3 [x]
2. Separate  control logic, model logic with data acces logic and view logic
3. Extract useful classes to make this usable outside Web context.
4. Port to Flask ? Though cutely we could keep CGI.
5. Probably stop using regexp to parse XML.
6. Modernize libraries etc.
7. We should very probably use json columns rather than weird separators and regexps.
